Order Process<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Writers get access to the list of orders and place their bids for the orders. In case the Writers have questions concerning the order, they have to clarify everything right away as they are responsible for obtaining the details.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Writer Assignment.<\/strong> Once the Customer accepts the Writer\u2019s bid, the Writer starts performing the order. The Customer and the Writer may communicate and discuss all the details via a messaging system.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Messaging System.<\/strong> The platform uses the messaging system for communication, which may be used by the Support Team and Writers as well.

Once such actions are detected, I3 reserves the right to terminate our cooperation without any further explanation.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Tracking the Order Status<\/strong>. When an order is created by a Customer, both the Customer and the Writer can use the tracking system to see the status of the order. The system reflects the status and percentage of the order completed. The possible statuses of the order are:<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Bidding \u2013 An order is created by a Customer. Customer waits for Writers\u2019 bids.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; In Progress \u2013 Customer selected a suitable Writer and approved the bid. Once the Customer accepted the bid, the funds were reserved for the order. Writer confirmed that all the instructions were clear and started the order performance. Writer delivers the product. Customer reviews it and asks for revision (if any).<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Under Investigation \u2013 Customer requested cancellation of the order; the order is being checked by the Quality Assurance Department or the Billing Department (in case there are issues with the payment). Usually, it takes up to 7 days to investigate the case and resolve the cancel request, but the period can be extended due to the high workload or peculiarities of certain orders. Money released to the Writer is put on hold. It does not return to the Customer\u2019s balance before the issue is resolved. If the Customer\u2019s claims were groundless, order changes to \u201cFinished\u201d status. If the Customer\u2019s claims were valid, order changes to \u201cCancelled\u201d status.<\/p>\n<p>The status may also be \u201cUnder Investigation\u201d if there was a payment issue from the Customer\u2019s side. Regardless of the reason for the investigation, the Writer has to stop performing the order and wait until the order changes the status.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Finished \u2013 Customer reviewed the final product after the last revision (if any) was provided by the Writer. Customer clicked the \u201crelease 100% money\u201d button. The Writer\u2019s fee stays on hold for 7 days in case the Customer requests a refund.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Cancelled &#8211; The order can be cancelled due to different reasons such as bad quality, Writer\u2019s failure to provide the product within the agreed deadlines, plagiarism, communication issues, or other technical nuances. Depending on the specific case, there may be financial implications towards Customers and Writers.<\/p>\n<p><strong>7. Delivery<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I3 shall not be responsible or liable for any type of delivery issues including those resulting from any of the Writer\u2019s service providers such as the Internet, email, etc., which are beyond our control. Our Support Team is available to assist Writers with any delivery problems.<\/p>\n<p><strong>8. Revisions, Reassignments, and Cancellations<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If the Product does not match the Customer\u2019s specifications and quality standards, the Writers have to revise it to ensure \u0421ustomer\u2019s satisfaction and release of payment. However, \u0421ustomers are not obliged to ask for revisions and can reassign the Writer in case of quality issues, failure to comply with the instructions, difficulties in understanding between Customer and Writer, and lateness of the Product delivery. In the event of reassignment,\u00a0 the Customer can not download and use the Writer\u2019s Product, and the Writer who has been reassigned does not receive any payment.<\/p>\n<p>After the money is released by the Customer, they can also request a limitless number of revisions within the following time frames:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>orders up to 10 pages &#8211; within 14 days after the money release;<\/li>\n<li>orders more than 10 pages &#8211; within 30 days after the money release.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If the Customer changes the initial instructions, the Writers have to inform the Customer that it is against policies. If the Customer insists on making a revision according to new instructions,\u00a0 the Writers should contact the Support Team and report the issue. If a revision request violates the original instructions, the Quality Assurance Department has the right to decline it.<\/p>\n<p>Customers also have a right to request the cancellation of the order. While checking the order by the Quality Assurance Department, the status on the order changes from \u201cIn Progress\u201d to \u201cUnder Investigation\u201d. It means that the Writer has to stop performing the order and wait for the resolvement.<\/p>\n<p>If the order is \u201cFinished\u201d, it can also be cancelled in case of high plagiarism rate after the Quality Assurance Department checks the plagiarism reports provided by the Customer from the valid checking software, namely SafeAssign, WriteCheck, or Turnitin.<\/p>\n<p>Cancellation request might be declined by the Quality Assurance Department if the Customer\u2019s actions do not have compelling reasons or they were not provided to us. If it is approved, the status of the order will be changed to \u201cCancelled\u201d. If it is declined, the status of the order will be changed to \u201cFinished\u201d, and the money reserved for the order will be released to the Writer. Based on the decision of the Quality Assurance Department, the Writer might receive full\/partial payment for the order or fine.<\/p>\n<p><strong>9.
