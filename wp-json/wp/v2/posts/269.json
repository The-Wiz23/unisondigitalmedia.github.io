This is very convenient since a freelancer is independent of any employer (instead of an employer, they have customers, and there are a lot of them). At the same time, you can independently plan your work schedule and even the amount of earnings.<\/p>\n<p>During the crisis, freelance writing work\u00a0has become a viable financial alternative for many and especially those who had difficulty finding a job. Also, <a href=\"https:\/\/lifehacks.io\/10-reasons-why-freelancing-is-better-than-any-job\/\"><u>freelancing is very convenient<\/u><\/a>\u00a0for those who for some reason can work from home\u00a0only.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, there are many ways to find a job for freelance writers.

Freelancing sites.<\/b><\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>If you do not want to waste time looking for vacancies and would prefer employers to find you instead, then you will need to look for specialized websites with vacancies for freelance writers. For example, you can use writingcreek.com.<\/p>\n<p>The downside of such sites is that they are only conditionally free. A free account has its limitations, for example, in the number of responses to your offer. They also charge some fee for additional functionality.<\/p>\n<p>Specialized sites with vacancies are convenient and can help you get started\u00a0because by signing up there, you can view all available writing offers in one place whether it is writing jobs for students\u00a0or something else.<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong><b>2. Former employers.<\/b><\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>If you are looking for an extra job or remote work at home, then it is quite possible that you will be able to get an order from your former boss.

Tell them that you are ready to work remotely and receive a piece-rate payment.<\/p>\n<p>To an employer, this option is doubly convenient: firstly, they already know what you are capable of, and, secondly, they do not need to worry about creating an additional workplace.<\/p>\n<p>We hope that you now understand why it is so important to leave companies &#8220;in an amicable way&#8221; and continue to maintain good relations with your former employers and colleagues.<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong><b>3. Potential employers<\/b><\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Think what companies might need your creative writing\u00a0skills to jump off your freelance writing career. And, since we are talking about remote work, there are unlimited potential companies: you can look for work not only in other cities but even in other countries. Payment, in this case, can be done to your credit card, bank account, etc.<\/p>\n<p>It is necessary to draw up a list of potential employers, find the necessary contacts, and then send out your CV. With employers who are in your city, most likely, it will be necessary to meet them personally.<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong><b>4. Trainings and subsequent employment.<\/b><\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Some freelance training centers, after graduation, either help with employment or provide their Internet resources for posting your profile for beginners. The training itself also usually takes place online.<\/p>\n<p>Customers know about such sites and purposefully research\u00a0the right specialists there.<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><strong><b>5.
