                  Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile

                  preference not to have data about your online browsing
                  activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform
                  technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT

                  However, if we cannot verify your identity from the
                  information already maintained by us, we may request that you
                  provide additional information for the purposes of verifying
                  your identity and for security or fraud-prevention purposes.
                  We will delete such additionally provided information as soon
                  as we finish verifying you.
