                  <strong>4. STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENTS TO THE PRODUCT</strong>
                </p>
                <p>Product has to be:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>original and based on proper argumentation;</li>
                  <li>structured logically and coherent;</li>
                  <li>
                    written in accordance with the English grammar, stylistic,
                    and punctuation rules;
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    composed in the way to meet all the Customer’s instructions
                    and templates;
                  </li>
                  <li>provided on time.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  Writers have to follow these formatting requirements, unless
                  asked for something different by the Customer:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>application of 1 margin on all sides;</li>
                  <li>
                    all parts, including the header, must be in Times New Roman
                    with font size 12;
                  </li>
                  <li>the body should be left-aligned;</li>
                  <li>
                    line spacing must be double, and paragraph spacing must be
                    0.00;
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    the formatting shall be made according to the format
                    required by the Customer or any of the Writer’s preferences
                    if there are no specific instructions (MLA and APA are
                    preferred).
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  Plagiarism:<br />
                  The plagiarism level must be less than 10%, which is checked
                  with the help of our in-built plagiarism checker. When
                  defining the plagiarism level, bibliographical references and
                  cliched phrases are not taken into account. Orders that
                  contain more than 10% of plagiarized information are hidden
                  from Customers and checked by Support Agents individually. For
                  solving the issue faster, Writers have to contact the Support
                  Team, indicate Order ID, and explain the plagiarism rate.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Violation of the standards and requirements stated above will
                  result in fines and the limitation of access to new orders, or
                  may even lead to termination of cooperation.
                </p>
                <p><strong>5. ACTIVATION OF ACCOUNT</strong></p>
                <p>
                  Writers are freelancers and are free to apply for an account
                  if they have reached the age of 18. For an Account to be
                  considered for activation, the Writer has to fill in the
                  registration form at the Site, pass the English grammar test,
                  write a sample piece of content on a given topic, and provide
                  ID and Diploma/Certificate, CV/Resume.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Any information provided by applicants will be treated as
                  “personal data” and shall be processed strictly in accordance
                  with our Privacy Policy, and will not be shared with any other
                  third party, except for our contractors involved for business
                  facilitation purposes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Within 5-10 business days, the Writers are notified on whether
                  their application is approved or declined. However, the
                  activation period can be extended due to the high number of
                  applicants. Our Recruiter can also ask the Writer to specify
                  some additional information or correct the existing one. In
                  case of application denial, we reserve the right not to
                  disclose the reason for it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Upon Activation of Account and authorization of contact
                  information, including phone verification, the Writer has to
                  pass an adaptation program, which includes onboarding and
                  educational tasks. Once the adaptation program is completed,
                  the Writer receives the possibility to place bids for orders
                  and start earning money.
                </p>
                <p>
                  While registering on the Site, the Writers have to provide a
                  valid email address and a phone number where they can be
                  reached. Support Agents may need to contact them. Providing
                  incorrect information is a violation of these Terms. After
                  Activation of Account, in case the Writer wants to make
                  significant changes in the account details, the Writer may be
                  required to verify the identity.
                </p>
                <p><strong>6. ORDER PROCESS</strong></p>
                <p>
                  Writers get access to the list of orders and place their bids
                  for the orders. In case the Writers have questions concerning
                  the order, they have to clarify everything right away as they
                  are responsible for obtaining the details.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Writer Assignment</strong>. Once the Customer accepts
                  the Writer’s bid, the Writer starts performing the order. The
                  Customer and the Writer may communicate and discuss all the
                  details via a messaging system.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Messaging System</strong>. The platform uses the
                  messaging system for communication, which may be used by the
                  Support Team and Writers as well. Writers can contact the
                  Customers and the Support Team using it, and they undertake to
                  check the messages regularly and promptly address any
                  questions, concerns, or additional instructions using this
                  interactive tool.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Writers are not allowed to disclose personal information to
                  Customers and ask them to deal directly without using
                  Writingcreek.com. Once such actions are detected, we reserve
                  the right to terminate our cooperation without any further
                  explanation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Tracking the Order Status</strong>. When an order is
                  created by a Customer, both the Customer and the Writer can
                  use the tracking system to see the status of the order. The
                  system reflects the status and percentage of the order
                  completed. The possible statuses of the order are:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Bidding</strong> – An order is created by a
                    Customer. Customer waits for Writers’ bids.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>In Progress</strong> – Customer selected a suitable
                    Writer and approved the bid. Once the Customer accepted the
                    bid, the funds were reserved for the order. Writer confirmed
                    that all the instructions were clear and started the order
                    performance. Writer delivers the product. Customer reviews
                    it and asks for revision (if any).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Under Investigation</strong> – Customer requested
                    cancellation of the order; the order is being checked by the
                    Quality Assurance Department or the Billing Department (in
                    case there are issues with the payment). Usually, it takes
                    up to 7 days to investigate the case and resolve the cancel
                    request, but the period can be extended due to the high
                    workload or peculiarities of certain orders. Money released
                    to the Writer is put on hold. It does not return to the
                    Customer’s balance before the issue is resolved. If the
                    Customer’s claims were groundless, order changes to
                    “Finished” status. If the Customer’s claims were valid,
                    order changes to “Cancelled” status. The status may also be
                    “Under Investigation” if there was a payment issue from the
                    Customer’s side. Regardless of the reason for the
                    investigation, the Writer has to stop performing the order
                    and wait until the order changes the status.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Finished</strong> – Customer reviewed the final
                    product after the last revision (if any) was provided by the
                    Writer. Customer clicked the “release 100% money” button.
                    The Writer’s fee stays on hold for 14 days in case the
                    Customer requests a refund.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Cancelled</strong> – The order can be cancelled due
                    to different reasons such as bad quality, Writer’s failure
                    to provide the product within the agreed deadlines,
                    plagiarism, communication issues, or other technical
                    nuances. Depending on the specific case, there may be
                    financial implications towards Customers and Writers.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>7. DELIVERY</strong></p>
                <p>
                  We shall not be responsible or liable for any type of delivery
                  issues including those resulting from any of the Writer’s
                  service providers such as the Internet, email, etc., which are
                  beyond our control. Our Support Team is available to assist
                  Writers with any delivery problems.
                </p>
                <p>

                    >8. REVISIONS, REASSIGNMENTS, AND CANCELLATIONS</strong
                  >
                </p>
                <p>
                  If the Product does not match the Customer’s specifications
                  and quality standards, the Writers have to revise it to ensure
                  Customer’s satisfaction and release of payment.
                </p>
                <p>
                  However, Customers are not obliged to ask for revisions and
                  can reassign the Writer in case of quality issues, failure to
                  comply with the instructions, difficulties in understanding
                  between Customer and Writer, and lateness of the Product
                  delivery. In the event of reassignment, the Customer cannot
                  download and use the Writer’s Product, and the Writer who has
                  been reassigned does not receive any payment.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After the money is released by the Customer, they can also
                  request a limitless number of revisions within the following
                  time frames:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    orders up to 10 pages – within 14 days after the money
                    release;
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    orders more than 10 pages – within 30 days after the money
                    release.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  If the Customer changes the initial instructions, the Writers
                  have to inform the Customer that it is against policies. If
                  the Customer insists on making a revision according to new
                  instructions, the Writers should contact the Support Team and
                  report the issue. If a revision request violates the original
                  instructions, the Quality Assurance Department has the right
                  to decline it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Customers also have a right to request the cancellation of the
                  order. While checking the order by the Quality Assurance
                  Department, the status on the order changes from “In Progress”
                  to “Under Investigation”. It means that the Writer has to stop
                  performing the order and wait for the resolvement.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If the order is “Finished”, it can also be cancelled in case
                  of high plagiarism rate after the Quality Assurance Department
                  checks the plagiarism reports provided by the Customer from
                  the valid checking software, namely SafeAssign, WriteCheck,
                  Turnitin, or Copyleaks.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Cancellation request might be declined by the Quality
                  Assurance Department if the Customer’s actions do not have
                  compelling reasons or they were not provided to us. If it is
                  approved, the status of the order will be changed to
                  “Cancelled”.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If it is declined, the status of the order will be changed to
                  “Finished”, and the money reserved for the order will be
                  released to the Writer. Based on the decision of the Quality
                  Assurance Department, the Writer might receive full/partial
                  payment for the order or fine.

                  If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not

                  suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not

                <p><strong>11. PAYMENT</strong></p>
                <p>
                  Once the Customer accepts the Writer’s bid, the funds are
                  reserved for the order. The Writer’s fee is released either by
                  the Customers if they are satisfied with the Product, or by
                  the system 4 business days after the deadline set by the
                  Customer if no issues have been raised.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Upon the release, the funds stay on hold for 14 days in case
                  the Customer requests a refund. There is no chance to request
                  the payout of these funds sooner.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Payout takes place once a fortnight on Wednesdays. Writers are
                  able to see the payout date on My Balance page and the payment
                  email chosen for payout, and it is their responsibility to
                  check the correctness of the provided details.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Writer has a right to choose the Payment Method that we
                  will use for the processing of any payments. The following
                  Payment Methods are available: Payoneer and Hyperwallet. In
                  case the Writer has indicated a wrong payment method, he/she
                  has to contact the Support Team and ask to cancel the previous
                  payout request and create a new one.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In case of the termination of account, the funds are sent via
                  the last valid payment method chosen by the Writer. After
                  closing the account, Writers are not allowed to change the
                  payment details, and we are not responsible for inaccurate or
                  invalid payment details they submitted.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Only an account holder assumes responsibility for anything an
                  authorized user does on an account and thus must not give
                  access to his/her account to third parties for the sake of
                  security. If the account has been hacked, we are not
                  responsible for the payment requests that were made.
